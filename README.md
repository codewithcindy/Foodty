## Foodty (A map to log your food ratings)

This is my re-creation of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman)'s Mapty project from his Udemy JS 2020 course.
https://foodty.netlify.app/

## Features included from the original Mapty

- Show input form when map is clicked
- Display input as an array/list
- Move map view to clicked item

## Added/Changed Features:

- Project is for food logs instead of workout logs
- Sort list based on price, rating, or most recently added
- Delete items from list and from map
- Clear all items button (remove all items from local storage)
- Hide form button

## Built With:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Map generated with the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) Library
- Deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
